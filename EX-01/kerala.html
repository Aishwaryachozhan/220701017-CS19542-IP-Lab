    <h1>Kerala Overview</h1>

    <h2>Cultural Heritage and History</h2>
    <p>Kerala, located in the southwestern corner of India, is renowned for its rich cultural heritage and historical significance. Known as "God's Own Country," Kerala boasts a history of trade and cultural exchange due to its strategic location along the Arabian Sea. The state's cultural richness is highlighted by traditional art forms such as Kathakali, a classical dance-drama known for its elaborate costumes and expressive performances, and Mohiniyattam, a graceful dance performed by women. Kerala's historical landmarks include the Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram and the Guruvayur Temple, which reflect its deep spiritual traditions. Festivals like Onam and Vishu celebrate the state's agricultural roots and community spirit with vibrant processions, feasts, and cultural performances.</p>

    <h2>Geographical and Natural Beauty</h2>
    <p>Kerala’s geography is characterized by a diverse range of natural landscapes, contributing to its scenic beauty and ecological significance. The state is bordered by the Arabian Sea to the west, featuring picturesque beaches like Kovalam and Varkala. The backwaters of Kerala, a network of interconnected lakes, rivers, and canals, are famous for their tranquil houseboat cruises. Inland, the Western Ghats run parallel to the state's eastern border, providing lush forests, rich biodiversity, and several wildlife sanctuaries such as Periyar and Silent Valley National Parks. This varied terrain supports a robust agricultural sector, with crops like rubber, coconut, and spices playing a crucial role in the state’s economy.
